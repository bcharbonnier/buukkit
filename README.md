TODO:

- add file upload
- delete image (to avoid having to do it twice for each entity type in the datastore manually)
- from home page, allow to copy in clipboard the image url directly (or at least, instead of using random.gif, get a random image, but insert it with the right URL in the page, and show that URL in the page too, so it can quickly be copied)
- accept width/height request attributes and resize images with PIL
